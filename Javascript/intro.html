    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>What is JavaScript ?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. </p>
    <p>It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages,
       and many non-browser environments also use it.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments 
        as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language.</p><p> JavaScript 
        contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, 
        control structures, and statements.</p>
    <h2>How to Link JavaScript File in HTML ?</h2>
    <p><b>Internal JS:</b> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the &lt;script&gt; tag. The  
        &lt;script&gt; tag can either be placed inside the &lt;head&gt; or the  &lt;body&gt; tag according to the requirement.</p>
    <p><b>External JS:</b> We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then link this file inside the &lt;head&gt; 
        tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</p>
    <h2>Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language ?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is considered lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement, and has a minimalist syntax. 
       Minimalist syntax as in, has no data types. Everything is treated here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax 
       similar to C++ and Java.</p>
    <p>A lightweight language does not consume much of your CPU’s resources. It doesn’t put excess strain on your CPU or RAM. 
        JavaScript runs in the browser even though it has complex paradigms and logic which means it uses fewer resources than 
        other languages. For example, NodeJs, a variation of JavaScript not only performs faster computations but also uses fewer 
        resources than its counterparts such as Dart or Java.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when compared with other programming languages, it has fewer in-built libraries or frameworks, contributing 
       as another reason for it being lightweight. However, this brings a drawback in that we need to incorporate external libraries 
       and frameworks. </p>
