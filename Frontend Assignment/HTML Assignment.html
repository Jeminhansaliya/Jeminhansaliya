   merge or combine the number of cells in a row whereas the colspan is used to merge column 
   cells in a table.</p>
   <p>Like Example.</p>

   <p><b>Q-11)What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</b></p>
   <p>Inline elements don't start in a new line. Block elements always start in a line. Inline elements allow 
      other inline elements to sit behind. Block elements have top and bottom margin.</p>
   <p>Inline elements occupy only sufficient width required and Block Elements occupy the full width 
      irrespective of their sufficiency.</p>
   <p>&lt;div&gt;,&lt;table&gt;,&lt;address&gt;...etc are block level elements.</p>
   <p>like under the example.</p>
   <div>block</div>
   <div>block</div>
   <div>block</div>
   <p>&lt;abbr&gt;,&lt;b&gt;,&lt;dfn&gt;...etc are inline elements.</p>

   <p><b>Q-12)How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</b></p>
   <p>The HTML &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink.</p>
   <p>he most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.</p>
   <p>The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the 
      specified URL address.</p>
   <p>Like Example.</p>

      is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.</p>
   <p>The &lt;span&gt; tag is much like the &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element and &lt;span&gt; is an 
      inline element.</p>
   <p>Like Example.</p>
   <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has 
      <span style="color:rgb(109, 66, 2);font-weight:bold">light brown</span> eyes.</p>

   <hr>
   <p><b>Q-16)How are active links different from normal links?</b></p>
   <p>Normal links are links which are there on the page and have not been clicked yet. Active links are those links, which have 
      just been clicked at that instant.</p>
   <p>Typically a Link is displayed in three different colors based on the usage.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Normal links (Unvisited links)</li>
      <li>Visited links</li>
      <li>Active links</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>Normal links (Unvisited links)</b></p>
   <p>you can get the normal link through this code. The default color is blue color and underlined but you can apply your own 
      custom styling according to the application’s need.</p>
   <p><b>Visited links</b></p>
   <p>If you click on the link shown above and again go back to the link page, you can now see the link is in purple color and 
      underlined. It shows that the user has visited this link before. You can do your own custom styling using CSS :visited 
      selector.</p>
   <p><b>Active links</b></p>
   <p>If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. Active Links 
      shows that the browser is in the process to load a new resource.</p>
   <p><b>Q-17)What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</b></p>
   <p>We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:</p>
   <p> &lt;br&gt; tag:It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.</p>
   <p> &lt;p&gt;tag:This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.</p>

   <p><b>Q-18)What is SVG?</b></p>
   <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web.</p>
   <p>An SVG image begins with an &lt;svg&gt; element.The width and height attributes of the &lt;svg&gt; element define the width and 
      height of the SVG image.</p>
   <p>The &lt;circle&gt; element is used to draw a circle.The cx and cy attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the 
      circle. If cx and cy are not set, the circle's center is set to (0, 0).The r attribute defines the radius of the circle.</p>
   <p>The stroke and stroke-width attributes control how the outline of a shape appears. We set the outline of the circle to a 4px green "border"</p>
   <p>The fill attribute refers to the color inside the circle. We set the fill color to yellow.The closing &lt;svg&gt; tag closes the SVG image</p>
