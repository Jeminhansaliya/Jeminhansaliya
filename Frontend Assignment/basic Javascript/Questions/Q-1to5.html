    <p>JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>1. Open your favorite browser (here we will use Google Chrome).</p>
    <p>2. Open the developer tools by right clicking on an empty area and select Inspect. Shortcut: F12 . Inspect Browser.</p>
    <p>3. On the developer tools, go to the console tab. Then, write JavaScript code and press enter to run the code.</p>

    <p><strong>Q-2)How many type of Variable in JavaScript?</strong></p>
    <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.</p>
    <p>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).</p>
    <p>Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.</p>
    <p>After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.</p>

    <p><strong>Q-3)Define a Data Types in js?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Number</strong>:JavaScript numbers are always stored in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. Unlike other programming languages, you don’t need int, float, etc to declare different numeric values.</p>
    <p><strong>String</strong>:JavaScript Strings are similar to sentences. They are made up of a list of characters, which is essentially just an “array of characters, like “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc</p>
    <p><strong>Boolean</strong>:Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.</p>
    <p><strong>Null</strong>:This type has only one value that is null.</p>
    <p><strong>Undefined</strong>: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.</p>
    <p><strong>Symbol</strong>: Symbols return unique identifiers that can be used to add unique property keys to an object that won’t collide with keys of any other code that might add to the object.</p>
    <p><strong>BigInt</strong>:BigInt is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253-1.</p>
    <p><strong>Object</strong>:It is the most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in detail in further articles.</p>

    <p><strong>Q-4)Write a mul Function Which will Work Properly When invoked With Following Syntax.</strong></p>
    <p>function mul(x) { </p>
    <p>            return function(y) { </p>
    <p>                return function(z) { </p>
    <p>                    return x*y*z; </p>
    <p>        }; </p>
    <p>      } </p>
    <p>    } </p>
    <p>      </p>
    <p>    console.log(mul(1)(3)(2)); </p>
    <p>    console.log(mul(2)(5)(2)); </p>
    <script>
       function mul(x) { 
            return function(y) { 
                return function(z) { 
                    return x*y*z; 
        }; 
      } 
    } 
      
    console.log(mul(1)(3)(2)); 
    console.log(mul(2)(5)(2)); 
    </script>

    <p><strong>Q-5)What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Undefined</strong>:It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword.</p>
