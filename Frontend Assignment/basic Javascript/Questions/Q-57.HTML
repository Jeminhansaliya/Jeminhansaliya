    <p>        In JavaScript, there are several types of events that can occur in the browser, and you can
        use them to trigger functions or behaviors in response to user actions or other
        interactions. Here are some common types of JavaScript events:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mouse Events:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>click: Occurs when the mouse button is clicked.</li>
            <li> dblclick: Occurs when the mouse button is double-clicked.</li>
            <li>mousedown, mouseup: Occur when the mouse button is pressed down or released.</li>
            <li>mousemove: Occurs when the mouse pointer is moved.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>focus, blur: Occur when an element gains or loses focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Window Events:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>load: Occurs when the document and its resources (like images and stylesheets) have finished loading.</li>
            <li>unload: Occurs when the user leaves the page.</li>
            <li>resize: Occurs when the browser window is resized.</li>
            <li>scroll: Occurs when the document view or an element is scrolled.</li>

        <li>Event Delegation:</li>
        <ul>
