        <h2>Q.47 What is the drawback of declaring methods
            directly in JavaScript objects?</h2>

        <fieldset>
            <pre>
    <p>          One drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that it leads to code
        duplication if the method is intended to be shared among multiple instances of the object.
        When you define a method directly within an object, each instance of that object gets its
        own copy of the method. This can result in increased memory consumption and can be less
        efficient than if the method were shared among all instances through the prototype chain.</p>
