        <h2>Q.58 What is Bom vs Dom in JS?</h2>
        <fieldset>
            <pre>
    <p>
        BOM (Browser Object Model) and DOM (Document Object Model) are two different but closely
        related concepts in JavaScript that deal with interacting with web browsers.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>DOM (Document Object Model):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents the
                structure of a document as a tree of objects. These objects can be manipulated using
                JavaScript to change the content, structure, and style of a web page.</li>
            <li>The DOM represents the HTML or XML document as a tree structure, where each element,
                attribute, and piece of text in the document is a node in the tree.</li>
            <li>JavaScript interacts with the DOM to dynamically update or manipulate the content
                and structure of a web page. For example, you can use DOM methods to create, modify,
                or delete elements on a page.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>BOM (Browser Object Model):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The BOM, on the other hand, represents additional objects provided by the browser to
                interact with the browser itself, rather than the document.</li>
            <li>The BOM includes objects such as window, navigator, screen, location, history, and
                document (which is also part of the DOM).</li>
            <li>The window object, in particular, is a top-level object in the BOM and represents
                the browser window. It provides methods and properties for manipulating the browser,
                such as opening new windows, setting timeouts, and handling events related to the
                window.</li>
            <li>Unlike the DOM, the BOM is not standardized, and its features can vary between
                different browsers.</li>
        </ul>
