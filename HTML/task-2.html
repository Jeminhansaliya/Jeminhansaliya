        <p>&lt;html&gt; — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.</p>
        <p>&lt;head&gt; — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer
           programs.</p>

        <h2>What is the boilarplate of html?</h2>
        <p>boilerplate code or just boilerplate are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. 
           A boilerplate in HTML is a template you will add at the start of your project. You should add this boilerplate to all of 
           your HTML pages.</p>

        <h2>What is the tags and attributes in html?</h2>
        <p>HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content. HTML attributes are used to describe the

           tag are HTML elements.</p>
        <p>Tag and attribute are two concepts related to HTML. The main difference between tag and attribute is that a tag is a way 
           of representing an HTML element in the program, while an attribute is a way of describing the characteristics of an HTML 
           element.</p>
